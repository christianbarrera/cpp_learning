#  Calculator app

The goal from the user is to get the right hand operation.  Make it a very basic calculator for now.  Take in number from users and take in an operator (+, -, /, *) and then run that operator on them.  Treat the result that you get as the next first number unless they give you a special key that is 'c' (aka clear).  Quit if you get the 'q' key.
